# SystemY
A java distributed file system

## Set up
- Make sure there is a "Local" and "Replication" folder in the "Working_Node/Files" directory. Put some existing files in the "Local" folder.

### Nameserver
- Start Main.java

### Node
- The application will ask for the IP adress of the nameserver and the name of the node in the first UI screen.
- The node will try to connect with the running nameserver on the given IP adres and has the ID equals the hashed given name.
- If it succeeds, the next UI will open and all of the systems functions are shown.
